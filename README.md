a simple google keep lookalike, for study purposes. has:

* **login system**: using devise gem, it has the whole functionality of a login system;
* **personal notes**: only the person who created the notes can see them;
* **ajax**: with a few lines of jquery, the index page (when the user is logged) has the whole crud functionality working on ajax, without reloading the page; although, if you want to, you can also do this the usual way (the show, new and update views).
* **bootstrap**: i used card columns to make the effect when a card is created look better. related to that, i used a bootswatch theme, with ~~drastical~~ a few changes;

## soon...
- [ ] a view for the welcome page when a user is not logged in
